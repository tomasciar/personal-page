              Recently, I have been using Python + libraries to work on a competitive version of PokeDoku. The plan is
              to have leaderboards, rankings and performance analysis. It's not done yet, so stay tuned for updates
              regarding that.

              My last big project was Foodmaps, a food deal scraping and aggregation service that finds all of the major
              food deals in a queried area. The service is discontinued, but the codebase is entirely public and can be
              found

            Coding is for real what I do most of the day and I love talking about it. Lately, I have been using a lot of
            Python and looking into how AI can help fix the underlying issues of web scraping. Feel free to reach out by
